If you're interested in writing ES6

in the browser and have it work everywhere,

you can take a look at babeljs.io.

And what that does it takes the new features

in Javascript, lets you write them,

then it converts the code you write

into older Javascript into something

that will run on all browsers.

Template literal  :  ' ${myVaraible}'


---------------------------------------------------

When we use util.inherits method it only give acess to method and properties on prototype but to acess the methods defined in the function constructors 
we used .call and pass (this) to it.

// now we have acess to all the properties defined insode the function constructors .
