this is often a misunderstanding with web developers.

The DOM doesn't live inside the JavaScript engine really.

The browser uses the DOM to render the webpage

and gives JavaScript access to the DOM,

gives it features, so that it can

manipulate the DOM under the hood.

And when the DOM is changed, then the browser

will automatically regenerate,

recreate, re-render, the webpage,

and this is the basis for modern web applications.
