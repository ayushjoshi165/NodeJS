we see hoe libuv enable javascript to perform asynchronously so while reading the file using fs module

Libuv will go and ask the OS to do the work,

and then when the event is complete,

when it has finished reading the file,

please run this JavaScript code.

So this is the event loop,

and it might take a long time for this file to be read;

and that's okay because the JavaScript code will simply

keep running and then the event loop will keep checking

and when the file is finished reading and I have my string,

it will say you can now run this callback.
