So NodeJS implements something called CommonJS modules.

Oh well actually, one more big word alert.

CommonJS modules: that just means an agreed upon

standard for how code modules should be structured.

You may here the phrase CommonJS.

It's just a set of standards.

So NodeJS said the way that common

JS modules, the way that standard

says the way modules should be structured,

we agree with that.

So we're going to design a way for you to structure

your Javascript code in modules that

will follow this standard.

-------------------------------------------

First-class functions: everything you can do

with other types, like strings or numbers,

you can do with functions.

A lot of major programming languages

do not have this feature.

JavaScript does.
