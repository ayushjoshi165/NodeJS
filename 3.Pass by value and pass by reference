// pass by value
function change(g) {
  g = 1;
}

var b = 2;
change(b);
console.log(b);

//output is 2, so what happened inside the change function didnt imapct the value of b, becase b is premitive and inside the function g created 
// a copy of b  the value without affecting its value.

// pass by reference

// remeber objects in Javascript are passed by reference 

a = {};
function changeObj(a){
a.prop1 = {};
a.prop2 = function(){};
}
b.prop1 = {};
changeObj(b);
console.log(b);


//So remember this,

when I pass in an object, I can add properties

and change properties on that object,

and that will be reflected outside of the function

because of pass by reference.
