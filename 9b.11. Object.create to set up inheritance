So again, Object.create is a very simple,

clean and clear way to set up

a sequence of objects,

objects that inherit from one another,

a prototype chain.

And so this idea of setting this up,

is key to understanding how the event emitter

becomes a fundamental, core piece upon which

many other elements inside Node.js's core

are constructed.
