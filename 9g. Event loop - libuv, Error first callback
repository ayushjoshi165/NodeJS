we see hoe libuv enable javascript to perform asynchronously so while reading the file using fs module

Libuv will go and ask the OS to do the work,

and then when the event is complete,

when it has finished reading the file,

please run this JavaScript code.

So this is the event loop,

and it might take a long time for this file to be read;

and that's okay because the JavaScript code will simply

keep running and then the event loop will keep checking

and when the file is finished reading and I have my string,

it will say you can now run this callback.

---------------------------------

Error first callback - imp interview question 

It just means by default, by standard,

if you give me a function for a callback,

the first parameter I will pass to you is an error;

and if there was no error, I'll just give you a null

in that first parameter and then we go on

with the rest of the parameters.

So the first parameter is an error,

and that helps because maybe you have different orders

of parameters, different numbers of parameters,

different callbacks; but I can always rely

on the fact that the first parameter is the error.

And that helps me in structuring my functions.

So, I have an error-first callback

__dirname is an environment variable that tells you the absolute path of the directory containing the currently executing file.
