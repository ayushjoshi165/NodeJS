ES6 comes up with a way to export the function and then import it 

example :
greet.js

export function(){
console.log("Hello this is exported function ");
}



app.js

import * as greeting from 'greet';

here we are importing all the values which are exported we can also import perticulat values and assign it to a variable using "as"

import greet as greeting from "greet";


---------------------

so if you see module.exports its NOdeJS and if you see import export its ES6

----------------------------

To require code libraries we simple require it by name we dont need to provide the local address 
so if you see something require without path its mostly the core libraby

var util = require("util");

we can use same name for out module but we need to pass the local addrss as we do bt "./" or "../../"
instead we should use a different name

------------------------------------------------
