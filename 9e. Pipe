A pipe.

That's how you connect two streams.

You write to one stream

what is being read from another.

So, a node you can pipe from a readable stream

to a writeable stream,

and that makes sense

because if you're going to read,

the stream has to be readable,

and if you're going to write,

the stream has to be writeable.

So, you pipe from a readable,

I'm reading what's coming in, each chunk

and then I'm writing to the writeable stream that chunk,

what we just did when we copied the files.

But to see this visually,

we can imagine a readable stream
