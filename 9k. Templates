Templates in Express is a utility and by using templates we can write a simple text and then ultimately that will
be converted into an HTML and to use it we just need to specify the view engine and then extension of file

we can use it by installing the template engine using npm and then app.set as below


created view folder as it will look in the views folder

person.ejs
----------------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <link href="/assets/style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Person : <%=ID %> // here it will automatically pick the ID varaible as we passed it in out middleware
  </body>
</html>
---------------------
app.js



app.set('view engine' , 'ejs');

app.get('/person/:id', function(req,res){
    res.render('person', {ID : req.params.id})

})

we saw an issue of loading style.css because we have person in the url and to fix that we put "/" in front of asset to tell that is from root
